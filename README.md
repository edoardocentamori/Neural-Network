# Neural-Network

This is a project that I made together with Abhinav Dwivedi during our Machine Learning exam. 
We developed from scratch a Neural Network in plain Python writing our own backpropagation and grid search algorithms. The network can perform both classification and regression tasks and was trained using the [MONK dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems), a famous online repository used for machine learning algorithms comparison. 
Our discussion of what was done can be found in our [summary of the project](https://github.com/edoardocentamori/Neural-Network/blob/main/ML.pdf)
After the exam I modified a few things on my own generalizing a little the possible structures allowed by the neural network and the results can be found in this repository.
I've added a small notebook in which the datas form the first dataset are learned to show how the network can be trained and tested, to run it just use these commands from terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/Edoardo1997/Neural-Network.git
cd Neural-Network
jupyter notebook
```
and then move to the notebook 'Experiment.ipynb' from the opened browser.
